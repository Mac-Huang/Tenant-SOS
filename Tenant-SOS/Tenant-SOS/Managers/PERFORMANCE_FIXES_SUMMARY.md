# UI Freezing Fixes and Performance Improvements

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. DataController Initialization Issue
**Problem:** The `DataController` init method was using `Task { @MainActor in ... }` which could block the main thread during app startup.

**Fix:** Changed to load data synchronously first, then seed data asynchronously only if needed.

```swift
// Before (problematic):
init() {
    Task { @MainActor in
        loadData()
        if states.isEmpty {
            seedInitialData()
        }
    }
}

// After (fixed):
init() {
    loadData()
    if states.isEmpty {
        Task { @MainActor in
            seedInitialData()
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. SearchView Performance Issues
**Problem:** The `filteredLaws` computed property was performing expensive string filtering operations on every view refresh, causing UI freezing.

**Fixes:**
- Converted `filteredLaws` from computed property to `@State` variable
- Added async filtering with `Task.detached` to move heavy operations off main thread
- Added loading state indicator
- Implemented search debouncing (300ms delay) to prevent excessive filtering
- Used `LazyVStack` instead of regular `VStack` for better scrolling performance

### 3. DocumentsView Performance
**Problem:** Large lists of documents could cause scrolling issues.

**Fix:** Replaced `ForEach` with `LazyVStack` for lazy loading of document rows.

### 4. DataController Caching
**Problem:** Methods like `getCategories()` were recalculating results on every call.

**Fixes:**
- Added category caching with `_cachedCategories` property
- Added `clearCaches()` method called when data changes
- Improved search methods to avoid unnecessary work

## Additional Performance Improvements

### Memory Management
- Used `Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated)` for background processing
- Implemented proper async/await patterns
- Added proper cancellation for search debouncing

### UI Responsiveness
- Added loading states for long-running operations
- Used `LazyVStack` and `LazyVGrid` for large lists
- Minimized main thread blocking operations

### Search Optimization
- Added debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
- Moved filtering to background threads
- Added early returns for empty queries

## App Icon Setup
Created detailed instructions in `APP_ICON_SETUP.md` for properly setting up the app icon using Xcode's Asset Catalog system.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test on older devices** - Performance issues are more apparent on slower hardware
2. **Test with large datasets** - Add more mock data to stress-test the filtering
3. **Profile with Instruments** - Use Xcode's Time Profiler to identify any remaining bottlenecks
4. **Test memory usage** - Monitor memory usage during heavy operations

## Next Steps

1. Follow the app icon setup instructions
2. Test the app to ensure UI is responsive
3. Consider implementing SwiftData or Core Data for better data persistence if the app grows
4. Add error handling for async operations
5. Implement proper loading states throughout the app

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow iOS development best practices.
