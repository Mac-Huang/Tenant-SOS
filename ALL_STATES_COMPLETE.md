## Key Features

### 1. Automatic State Detection
When users travel between states, the app will:
- Detect their current location via GPS
- Show relevant laws for their current state
- Send notifications about key differences

### 2. Smart Law Comparisons
The app can compare laws between any two states and highlight:
- **Critical differences** (red) - Major changes like rent control, income tax
- **High importance** (orange) - Significant changes like minimum wage
- **Medium importance** (blue) - Notable differences
- **Low importance** (gray) - Minor variations

### 3. Notification System
When entering a new state, users receive notifications showing:
- Most important law differences (up to 3)
- State-specific regulations
- Critical changes they need to know
