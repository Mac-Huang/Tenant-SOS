- # Tenant-SOS: Native iOS Legal Awareness App for Apple Store

Create a native iOS application using Swift and SwiftUI that automatically detects users' locations and provides relevant local laws, tenant rights, and legal information as they travel between states. The app should be polished, App Store-ready, and feel like a premium personal legal assistant.

## iOS Native Implementation Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Minimum iOS Version**: iOS 16.0
- **Database**: Core Data with CloudKit sync
- **Location Services**: Core Location framework
- **Notifications**: User Notifications framework with push notifications
- **Backend**: Firebase or AWS Amplify for scalable backend services

### 1. Location Services & Geofencing
```swift
// Implement using Core Location
- CLLocationManager for real-time location tracking
- Region monitoring for state boundary detection
- Significant location change monitoring for battery efficiency
- Background location updates with proper battery optimization
- Geofencing for major cities with unique ordinances
```

### 2. User Onboarding & Profile
**First Launch Experience:**
- Privacy-focused location permission request with clear value proposition
- Push notification permission with benefit explanation
- Profile setup with smooth, native animations:
  - Home state selection with UIPickerView
  - Multi-state selection for frequent travel
  - Housing status (renter/owner/temporary)
  - Driver's license status
  - Employment type selection
  - Notification preferences (immediate/daily/weekly digest)

**Data Storage:**
- User defaults for settings
- Keychain for sensitive information
- Core Data for offline law database
- CloudKit for cross-device sync

### 3. Main Features Implementation

**Home Dashboard:**
- Current location card with state/city laws

**Privacy & Permissions:**
```
Info.plist keys required:
- NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription

- NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription
- NSMotionUsageDescription (for activity detection)
```

### 5. Monetization Strategy
- Freemium model:
  - Free: Basic state laws, 3 document generations/month
  - Pro ($4.99/month): Unlimited documents, all states, priority updates
- In-App Purchase implementation with StoreKit 2
- Subscription management interface
- Restore purchases functionality

### 6. Data Architecture

**Core Data Models:**
```swift
- State: name, code, lastUpdated
- LawCategory: housing, traffic, employment, consumer, tax
- Law: title, description, statute, effectiveDate, state
- UserProfile: homeState, frequentStates, preferences
- Document: template, generatedDate, state, type
- Bookmark: law, dateAdded, notes
```

**API Structure:**
- RESTful API for law updates
- WebSocket for real-time legal alerts
- Batch downloads for offline access
- Delta updates to minimize data usage

### 7. UI/UX Specifications

**Design System:**
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- Support Dynamic Type for accessibility
- Dark mode and light mode with system preference
- SF Symbols for consistent iconography
- Native iOS animations and transitions

**Key Screens:**
- Splash screen with app branding
- Onboarding flow (3-4 screens max)
- Tab bar navigation: Home, Search, Documents, Profile
- State detail view with collapsible sections
- Document editor with auto-save
- Settings with granular notification controls

### 8. Performance Requirements
- App launch time < 1 second
- Offline mode with cached data
- Background refresh for law updates
- Memory usage < 100MB active
- Battery efficient location tracking
- App size < 50MB initial download

### 9. Analytics & Crash Reporting
- Firebase Analytics or App Analytics
- Crashlytics for crash reporting
- User behavior tracking (with consent)
- A/B testing framework for features

### 10. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Unit tests with XCTest (>70% coverage)
- UI tests for critical user flows
- TestFlight beta testing program
- Accessibility testing with VoiceOver
- Performance testing with Instruments

### 11. Legal Compliance
- CCPA/GDPR compliant data handling
- Clear data deletion process
- Age gate if required
- Disclaimer about legal advice
- Regular legal database audits

### 12. App Store Submission Checklist
